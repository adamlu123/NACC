# NACC

This is a project investigating the association between race and NPI score (Neuropsychiatric Inventory
) for demented patients due Alzheimer's diseases. 

Alzheimer's diseases research relies on accurate assessment of patient change over time. Usually a participant is accompanied with an informant, assessments depend on accurate and consistent ratings by informant. 

Our goal is to utilize [NACC UDS](https://www.alz.washington.edu/WEB/forms_uds.html) dataset to determine whether there is racial difference fo the reportings of NPI score.
